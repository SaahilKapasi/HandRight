Entry for NewHacks 2023 Hackathon

A program developed for younger children to learn how to write properly

For the front end, we used Tkinter to create an interactive canvas for the user to draw on that sends an image to the backend to compare.

For the backend, we created and trained a Neural Network using PyTorch and the EMNIST dataset, which is a dataset containing a large collection of digits and letters. If you run the backend file, it'll create the neural network and save it to a file to be used when the frontend file is run.
